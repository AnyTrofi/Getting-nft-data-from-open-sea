# Getting-nft-date-from-open-sea
*Getting nft data from open sea without a API key*

>The opensea api has the ability to make test requests without a key, but it implies that they can only be made by a human in the browser, so we can use the Chrome driver kit with selenium to imitate a human and make any requests without restrictions

The get_all_nfts.py file provides the ability to copy all nfts from open using this method, but you can change the request and make absolutely any requests without restrictions
